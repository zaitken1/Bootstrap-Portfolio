# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

I have refactored my previous portfolio using Bootstrap components and utilities to minimise media queries as much as possible.

The website, which is linked below, contains the following:

* Bootstrap navbar and navigation with hover effect
* Hamburger menu on mobile to ensure responsiveness
* Jumbrotron containing image and text
* About section containing image, contact details and short bio text
* Portfolio section using Bootstrap grid and card components
* Skills section with written information and image
* Footer with Font Awesome social media icons and page links/navigation
